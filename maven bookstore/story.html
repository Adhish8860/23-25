      <h2>About Our Bookstore</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2025, Book Haven is a passion project built by a group of three BCA students as part of our college coursework. 
        More than just an assignment, this digital bookstore is a blend of our technical skills, creativity, and genuine love for books.
         From designing the user interface to handpicking features for fellow readers, weâ€™ve crafted Book Haven as a cozy, functional space for every book enthusiast.
          It's our way of turning code into community.
